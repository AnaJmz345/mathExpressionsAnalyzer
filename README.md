# Math Expressions Analyzer - Responsive UI

On this excercise you will implement a responsive UI for the [Math Expressions Analyzer](https://github.com/CodersSquad/ct-math-exp-analyzer/tree/main). The idea is to provide a web or desktop graphical interface that will provide real-time math expressions validation. As the user is typing a math expression, the program will display colored validation (red or green) and syntax high-lightening.


## Requirements
- A user interface (web or desktop) that supports a single expression input field
- As the user starts typing an expressions, the program should:
  - Validate on every pressed key and color the expression green (if valid) or red (if invalid)
  - As the operators, parenthesis and brackets are typed, the program should color highlight them
  - You are free to choose the character's types
- It must be implemented in a client-server like architecture, client (the web or desktop app) and the server (analyzer that you already implemented on previous excercise)


## Deliverables

- A [`project.pdf`](./project.pdf) document with the following content:
  - Presentation Page
  - Description of the project
  - Diagrams, charts and importante code snippets
  - Make sure that you explain how you're connecting the 2 client and server part of your program 
  - Conclusions (one per team member)
- [`HOWTO.md`](./HOWTO.md) with details on how to install and run your complete solution
